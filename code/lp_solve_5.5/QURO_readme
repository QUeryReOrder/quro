The ILP solver code is in the directory of quro/
Source file: ilp_test.cpp
To compile the program, run ./make_ilp
The compiled program takes queryinfo.txt as input, and print the result to console.

The current queryinfo.txt is a normal ILP input file with only units including queries.
The file large_queryinfo.txt is the ILP input file of trade-order transaction with all units,
which makes the ILP solver run more than hours.
