libpqxx-2.6 or newer is required.

The EGen Makefile needs to be edited to include the database libraries in order
to load the database.  Here is an example:

LDFLAGS=-lpqxx -lpq

If you are using non-standard (i.e. not in your path) locations, the following
adds include paths for CFLAGS and paths to the runtime library path to LDFLAGS:

LIBPG=path_to_postgresql_dir
LIBPQXX=path_to_libpqxx_dir
CCFLAGS=-ggdb -D__STDC_FORMAT_MACROS -D__STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS -I$(LIBPQXX)/include -I$(LIBPG)/include
LDFLAGS=-L$(LIBPQXX)/lib -lpqxx -L$(LIBPG)/lib -lpq -Wl,-R$(LIBPQXX)/lib -Wl,-R$(LIBPG)/lib

To build a small database possible:
	scripts/pgsql/build-db -c 1000 -i 1000 -s 500 -w 1

2-tier notes

Default PostgreSQL installations from CVS or source disable the tpc/ip listener
except for localhost connections.  It can be enabled through the
scripts/run-workload scripts using '-d "-c listen_addresses=*"' to enable
listening from all ip accresses, or by setting the postgresql.conf file.

The scripts/pgsql/create-db scripts will copy over a pg_hba.conf file only if
the scripts has to run initdb.  This pg_hba.conf enables anyone from anywhere
to connect to the database.
